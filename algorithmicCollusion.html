                    <p class="card-text">
                        Landlords today often use computer programs (algorithms) to help decide how much rent to charge.
                        An algorithm is a set of rules or a software tool that looks at various factors (like apartment
                        size,
                        location, demand, time of year) and then recommends a rent price. Companies offer these
                        rent-setting
                        algorithms to landlords as a way to maximize their profits. Instead of manually researching the
                        market
                        or guessing, a landlord can rely on the software's suggestion for the “optimal” rent.
                        In fact, many big property management firms use these tools for

                        The goal is usually to charge the highest rent that people are willing to pay.
                        One executive at a rent pricing company even admitted their software encouraged rent hikes that

                    <p class="card-text">
                        These rent algorithms don't set prices in a vacuum - they pay close attention to what other
                        landlords are charging. The

                          software often gathers data
                        </a> from nearby similar apartments to see the going rates. In some cases, companies even collect
                        private
                        pricing info from many landlords and
                        <a

                          feed it into a shared system
                        </a>.
                        Using all this market data, the algorithm adjusts its recommendations. For example, if the
                        apartment complex across the street bumps up its rent for a one-bedroom unit, the algorithm at
                        your building
                        might notice that and suggest you could raise your rent too. Conversely, if a competitor lowers
                        prices or offers a special deal, the software will know and might respond (perhaps telling your
                        landlord
                        to also slightly lower rent, or to hold firm if it predicts the competitor's drop is temporary).
                        This is
                        similar to how airlines or hotels set prices: constantly monitoring what others are doing and then
                        tweaking their own prices accordingly. The key point is that landlords' pricing software is always
                        watching the
                        competition and reacting to it, much faster and more consistently than any human landlord could.

                    <h3 class="card-title">When Algorithms Collude (Unintended Collusion)</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        “Collusion” is when businesses secretly cooperate instead of competing, usually to keep prices
                        high.
                        Normally, collusion is illegal - for instance, landlords aren't allowed to sit in a room together
                        and
                        agree, “Let's all charge $1,500 for one-bedroom apartments and not go lower.” But with algorithms,
                        something similar can happen without anyone explicitly plotting. Here's how: Imagine a city where
                        multiple
                        major landlords are all using the same or similar rent-setting algorithm. Because they're using
                        the same
                        tool (or tools that work in similar ways), they end up following the same playbook. If the
                        algorithm sees
                        strong demand in the city, it might tell every landlord using it to keep rents high. If one
                        landlord's
                        software raises rent, the others' software takes note and may raise their rents, too. None of
                        these
                        landlords called each other on the phone to agree on a price, but in effect their software is
                        coordinating
                        their moves.

                        <br>
                        This phenomenon is sometimes called “algorithmic collusion” or tacit collusion. It's “tacit” or
                        unintended in the sense that no person sat down and said “let's form a cartel.” Yet the outcome -
                        uniformly
                        high rents - is similar to what you'd see if there was a secret cartel. Regulators have noticed
                        this
                        problem. The U.S. Department of Justice, for example, alleges that a popular rent pricing
                        algorithm allowed
                        landlords to “align their rents” and
                        <a
                          href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-realpage-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions-american-renters#:~:text=way%20to%20scheme%20with%20landlords,%E2%80%9D">
                          avoid competing with each other
                        </a>.
                        Essentially, the software became a middleman that let landlords stick to a high-price strategy
                        together.
                        One former FTC official gave a useful illustration: she said to imagine replacing the word
                        “algorithm” with
                        “a guy named Bob.” If all the landlords gave Bob their private pricing information and Bob told
                        each of them
                        what rent to charge, that would clearly be
                        <a

                          illegal collusion
                        </a>. If it's not OK for a person to coordinate prices like that, it's also not OK when a computer
                        program
                        does it. In short, using fancy software doesn't magically make price-fixing legal. But many
                        landlords may
                        not even realize this is what's happening - they just see the software's recommendations and
                        follow along.
                        The result is a “silent agreement” of high prices: unintended by any single landlord, but very
                        real for renters
                        who have to pay those prices.

                            That's roughly a 4% increase in rent - solely due to the pricing software's effects - which

                            roommates or family just to make ends meet. In other words, the cost burden on renters
                            increases, and those with limited incomes are hurt the most. High, synchronized rents can price
                            some people out of certain neighborhoods entirely, contributing to housing crises and

                    <p class="card-text">
                    Think of it like this: imagine all the gas stations in town used the same automatic pricing app.
                    Each gas station owner types in some data, and the app tells them what price to put on the pump.
                    The
                    app also checks what all the other gas stations are charging. Now, if one station tries to lower
                    its
                    price to attract more customers, the app will notice and will likely tell the other stations to
                    lower their prices a bit too, so that first station doesn't get much of an edge. On the flip side,
                    if the app sees that one station can successfully raise prices (say, during a big event or
                    holiday),
                    it will prompt the others to raise their prices as well. In the end, all the gas stations end up
                    with pretty similar, higher prices. No owner ever called up another to agree on a price, but
                    because
                    they all followed the same software, the outcome is as if they had a gentle agreement not to
                    compete. Drivers in that town would find that no matter which gas station they go to, the price
                    per
                    gallon is high and nearly identical.

                    turning together. Renters are like the drivers looking for cheaper gas - they discover that every
                    apartment they visit has high rent, because the landlords' software has guided them all to keep
                    rents up. It's as if the landlords had a friendly pact to not undercut each other, even though
                    they
                    never spoke directly. The analogy shows why this is a problem: when businesses should be competing
                    on price but instead start acting in sync (thanks to an algorithm), consumers lose out. In rental
                    housing, that means families paying more for shelter and struggling with affordability, all
                    because
                    of a behind-the-scenes algorithm that unintentionally encouraged a form of collusion.
